<p>Builder Wars is a turn-based, strategy wargame that uses Lego bricks and minifigs as game pieces. It requires 1 game master, and 2-4 players. The game scenario, playability, fairness, and game flow are the responsibility of the game master (GM). The players follow the rules, invent things, and have fun!</p>

<p>Builder Wars allows for creativity and imagination not just by building, but through active play, strategy, storytelling, and inventing new rules of the game itself. Builder Wars games are fun, dramatic, silly and a great way to spend a day together with friends.</p>

<h3>Principles</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Games should be fun. If the rules of the game are preventing the players from having fun, the the GM should change the rules.</li>
  <li>Games should be fair. There is no special power or ability that can be granted to one player that cannot be granted or made available to all players.</li>
  <li>This game is a beta playtest experience for everyone involved. This means that there will be grey areas, and the GM will have to make stuff up. All players must agree not to fault the GM for adjudication during the game.</li>
  <li>New ideas are welcome. During gameplay, anyone that has an idea to make the game better is encouraged to share that idea, which is acknowledged and scribbled down by the GM for later review.</li>
  <li>Keep it simple. Better to start out simple and add complexity later.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Change Anything</h3>
<p>The Core Rules are available to the public under a Creative Commons license, hosted on Github, an online collaboration platform (normally used for software version control). Sharing is good. Remix even better. Github allows anyone to create their own version (“Fork”) of the rules, which could mean any amount of collaboration and new ideas.  We hope that by opening up the game this way, it might give people a reason to learn how to use Git and submit their own ideas that might end up in the Core Rules for everyone. Pretty nerdy, but cool if you think about it.</p>
<p>Contributors should familiarize themselves with how Github works. The help pages are pretty great. <a href="https://help.github.com">https://help.github.com</a></p>
